# Hi Marco! Welcome in MeetixOS 0.8

## What happened to the GUI?
Since August 31, 2021 I've found interest again in C++ development,
so I've decided to re-implement MeetiX using modern C++ and moving out to more Unix-like aspects;
then for this version the GUI is disabled by default, because the system is under heavy refactor
and many things doesn't work well anymore.

## Whats next?
Next steps involve a homemade template library (the MxT [M]eeti[x][T]emplates),
a complete refactor of the kernel (how it's written and how it works)
and next a completely new GUI framework!!!

Have fun!
