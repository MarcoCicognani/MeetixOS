 * This handler discovers (and creates virtual nodes for) the given absolute path.
 *
 * This is done by looking up all path elements as virtual nodes top-down.
 * If all of the path elements already exist as virtual nodes, this function immediately
 * returns true. Otherwise, the delegate is asked to discover and a {g_waiter_fs_discovery}
 * is appended to the task. This waiter waits for the discovery transaction to finish.
 *
 * The discovery process is called by the waiter itself repeatedly until all path elements
 * are successfully discovered or discovery fails at some point.
