# MeetixOS

MeetixOS, A hobby operating system for x86 computers written in modern C++.

## NB

Since I've found interest again in C++ and OSDevelopment I started rewriting most of the system using modern C++
features and porting the kernel/OS functionalities more to the Unix philosophy, but always trying new designs and
stuffs.

## Where is the GUI

The GUI is temporarily disabled since the old WindowServer is not stable enough, and because I want to develop a new
Compositor system, which allow by default to draw via canvas to a shared buffer
